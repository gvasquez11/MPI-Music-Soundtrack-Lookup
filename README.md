This program is written in C++ MPI which processes lines in order to output a value.
Each line of the 'in.txt' contains a string that represents concatenated musical notes from
famous Star Wars compositions. This program will read in these lines and scan them to determine
which of these famous Star Wars songs is represented. Once it determines which song it is,
it will output a time stamp of where you can find the song in it's respective film.
